## General

### What if my question isn't answered here?
Please contact me via the ```Contact Developer``` link on the appropriate Crystal Reborn store page ([Garmin Pay]({{ site.crystal_reborn_store_url }}) or [KiezelPay]({{ site.crystal-reborn_kpay_store_url }})) and I'll be in touch.

### Crystal Reborn versions
**The KiezelPay version of Crystal Reborn is coming soon.**

There are two versions of Crystal Reborn available in the Connect IQ store. The main difference is that KiezelPay supports more payment methods than Garmin Pay. There is no difference in features between the two versions.

| | Garmin Pay | KiezelPay |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Description** | First-party payments handled by Garmin. **RECOMMENDED**, if supported by your region and bank. | Third-party payments handled by KiezelPay. |
| **Store URL** | [Garmin Pay store page]({{ site.crystal_reborn_store_url }}). | [KiezelPay store page]({{ site.crystal-reborn_kpay_store_url }}). |
| **Supported regions** | Please see [this list of regions]({{ site.garmin_regions_url }}) supported by Garmin for first-party purchases. | All regions supported by PayPal, or your chosen payment method. |
| **Payment methods** | By **card**, from a smaller range of banks. | **PayPal** (free). Also by **card**, from a wider range of banks ($0.30 fee). |
| **Price** | **Cheaper** (exact price varies by region). | **More expensive**, because KiezelPay charges developers nearly double the fee compared to Garmin. |
| **Purchase process** | Payment is required before download. Garmin will send an e-mail once your payment has been processed. Crystal Reborn will then download and install automatically the next time your watch syncs. | Download is free. You will then have {{ site.crystal_reborn_kpay_trial_hours }} hours to try Crystal Reborn. After the trial period, you will be shown a 6-digit code and URL you can use to make the purchase via the KiezelPay site. Within 5 minutes of completing the purchase, Crystal Reborn will unlock. |
| **Purchase type** | One-off (not subscription). Purchase is forever, and tied to your Garmin account. | One-off (not subscription). Purchase is forever, and tied to your Garmin account. |

If you're considering a refund, please contact me first via the ```Contact Developer``` link on the appropriate store page, as I would like to try and make things right.

### Crystal Reborn won't install. Help!
Firstly, ensure your watch is [running the latest firmware](https://support.garmin.com/en-GB/?faq=ZKn5UHHyEF9J3MPROKwRj8). This should happen automatically, but there may be a short delay between the firmware becoming available, and it installing on your watch.

If that hasn't helped, try:
- Turning Bluetooth off and on again;
- Restarting your watch and your phone;
- Re-pairing your watch with your phone;
- Re-installing the Connect IQ app.

## Features

### How do I customise Crystal Reborn?
The easiest way is via the watch face settings **on the watch itself**. This varies slightly by model, but is something like ```[Main Menu] > Watch Face > [Edit] > Settings```. This will be the same as for other built-in and third-party watch faces.

Alternatively, you can use the **Connect IQ phone app**. From the main app screen: ```My Device > My Watch Faces > Crystal Reborn > Settings```.

For more information about what you can customise, see the [Crystal Reborn manual](/crystal-reborn/manual).

### How do I change between 12-hour and 24-hour format?
Change the **time format setting** via the general settings menu on your watch, and Crystal Reborn will pick up the change - there isn't a separate Crystal Reborn setting.
