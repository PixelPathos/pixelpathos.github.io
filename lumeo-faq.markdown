### What if my question isn't answered here?
Please contact me via the ```Contact Developer``` link on [Lumeo's store page]({{ site.lumeo_store_url }}) and I'll be in touch.

### Where can I download Lumeo?
Find Lumeo on [Garmin's Connect IQ Store]({{ site.lumeo_store_url }}).

### Garmin Pay doesn't work with my payment card, or in my country. Is there another way I can pay for Lumeo?
Sorry, not at the moment. However, I hope to release a separate version of Lumeo which will accept third-party payments (KiezelPay).

### I'm not happy with Lumeo. How do I get a refund?
I'm sorry to hear that. Garmin will allow you to [request a full refund](https://support.garmin.com/en-GB/?faq=tAsPhqUXOo2L3guHjLpJa7) within the first 48 hours after purchase.

If you're considering a refund, I'd appreciate it if you could contact me via [Lumeo's store page]({{ site.lumeo_store_url }}) to let me know what I can improve.

### Lumeo won't install. Help!
Firstly, ensure your watch is [running the latest firmware](https://support.garmin.com/en-GB/?faq=ZKn5UHHyEF9J3MPROKwRj8). This should happen automatically, but there may be a short delay between the firmware becoming available, and it installing on your watch.

If that hasn't helped, try:
- Turning Bluetooth off and on again;
- Re-pairing your watch with your phone;
- Re-installing the Connect IQ app.

### When will Lumeo be available for my watch?
Lumeo will be "soft launched", starting with the Venu® 3. In the following weeks, Lumeo will be rolled out to further devices relatively quickly, as support has already been implemented for tens of devices.

Following this initial launch period: Lumeo is custom-designed for each size of watch, and in some cases, even for specific watch models. This takes many hours of work, but I feel the process is worthwhile.

If your watch model is very new, Lumeo should be along shortly.

Older watches may be missing features that allow Lumeo to run. I hope to create new watch faces that will have even broader support than Lumeo. In the meantime, perhaps you'd like to try one of Pixel Pathos' other watch faces, like the ever-popular [Crystal]({{ site.crystal_store_url }})?

### How do I customise Lumeo?
On most watches, you can customise Lumeo via the watch face settings **on the watch itself**. Google ```watch face settings <my watch model>``` for the relevant page of the online owner's manual.

If your model does not support on-device settings, then you will need to use the **Connect IQ phone app** to customise Lumeo. From the main app screen: ```My Device > My Watch Faces > Lumeo > Settings```.

### What can I customise on Lumeo?
Almost everything: the layout, the colour, which complications are shown, the styles of the dials and meters, which indicators are shown, how long the graph history is, and so on.

### Why can't I change between 12-hour and 24-hour format?
You can change this via a **separate time format setting** on your watch - it's not a Lumeo setting, but Lumeo will respect it. Google ```change time format <my watch model>``` for the relevant page of the online owner's manual.

### Why does a symbol appear in grey on the watch face?
It's most likely because Lumeo can't determine a value for now. For example, if you take the watch off, it can't measure heart rate, so the heart symbol will appear in grey.

If your watch is a long distance from your phone, it will lose Bluetooth connection, and the Bluetooth symbol will appear in grey.

It may also be that your device does not support that particular complication. For example, Approach® S50 and vívoactive® 5 devices don't support Floors Climbed, so that symbol will appear in grey.
